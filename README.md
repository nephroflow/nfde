# NephroFlow Development Environment Manager

Switch NephroFlow development environments easily.

## Dump and restore databases

Include `export PGPASSWORD=...` in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. This way,
you don't have to enter the postgres password for every postgres action.

### Dump

1. Start the postgres service (with exposed ports): `docker-compose run --service-ports postgres`
2. `nfde database dump $name`

### Restore

1. Start the postgres service (with exposed ports): `docker-compose run --service-ports postgres`
2. Make sure nothing is using the database (the tool will only try to kill
   the `rails` process of the `web` service)
3. `nfde database restore` will open a fuzzy picker of your saved database
